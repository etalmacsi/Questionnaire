# Task #1
__Epic:__ Questionnaire Editor

### User Story
**As** an **Interviewer**
<br>**I** would like to have an application which lists my questions and its answers
<br>And **I** can update my question list anytime
<br>So **I** can update and check my questions pretty fast

### Features
__Mandatory:__
- list existing questions with creation date
- list answers under existing questions (if it is missing, write your own answer)
- add new question with answer to the list
- simple, fancy style

__Optional__:

- edit existing questions and answers
- show star rating of a question in the list (update those values based on your insights)
- store the list and restore it when the app is opened
- side menu with fast links on questions
- notifications for actions

### Pre-requirements:
- an editor of your choice
- `index.html` (add your name in `title`), `app.js`, `main.css` (you can have more files if you wish but you should have these in your solution)
- use just native javascript (ES6 allowed), CSS and HTML
- ___DO NOT USE___ libraries or frameworks at all, just your own code
- if it's necessary, jQuery can be an exception
- questions can be fetched from here: `https://slvbudpeterm.blob.core.windows.net/recruitment/questions.json`
